		<p>I&rsquo;m a medical student in University of New Mexico's Combined
			BA/MD Program. I completed an interdisciplinary BA in 
			Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Physical &amp; Natural Sciences, and 
			Social Sciences with minors in Navajo Language &amp; Linguistics and 
			Chicana &amp; Chicano Studies in 2015 and was a Visiting Student in the 
			Dept. of Economics at Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 
			2015-2017.</p>

		<h2>Research Interests</h2>
		<p>My previous research documented growing disparity in the rates of 
			tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) utilization between rural and urban 
			hospitals and the effectiveness of Primary Stroke Center accreditation in
			closing the gap. I have also shown substantial variation in 
			rates of health insurance coverage among different Latino groups, 
			differences in the relationships with the likelihood of having health 
			insurance with factors such as immigration status, 
			and that substantial reductions in coverage disparities both among 
			Latinos and between Latinos and Whites were concurrent with 
			implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid expansion.
		</p>
		<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m interested in identifying modern and historical sources of
			structural and implicit racism, particularly in the Southwest and West.
